# Analysis of High Growth in July and October

## Overview

The factor-based forecast models (Conservative, Moderate, Ambitious) show exceptionally high growth for July and October 2025 compared to other months. This document explains the key factors contributing to these projections.

## Data Comparison

| Month | 2024 Actual | Conservative 2025 | Moderate 2025 | Ambitious 2025 | ARIMA 2025 |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| July | 98.08 | 140.10 (42.8%) | 152.60 (55.6%) | 165.10 (68.3%) | 65.27 (-33.5%) |
| October | 86.02 | 132.45 (54.0%) | 144.30 (67.8%) | 156.15 (81.5%) | 65.27 (-24.1%) |
| Average (All Months) | 60.29 | 68.36 (8.7%) | 74.46 (18.4%) | 80.57 (28.1%) | 65.27 (14.1%) |

## Key Factors Driving High Growth

### 1. High Seasonality Indices

The seasonality index, calculated from 2023-2024 data, shows that July and October have significantly higher values than other months:

- July: 1.34 (34% above average)
- October: 1.50 (50% above average)

These are the two highest seasonality indices among all months, indicating strong historical seasonal patterns for these periods.

### 2. Already High Base Values

The 2024 actual values for July and October are already substantially higher than the average:

- July 2024: 98.08 (62.7% above the 2024 average of 60.29)
- October 2024: 86.02 (42.7% above the 2024 average)

The factor-based models apply growth factors and multipliers to these already high base values.

### 3. Multiplicative Effect

The factor-based forecast calculation multiplies:
- Base 2024 value
- Seasonality index
- Media multiplier
- Flight search factor
- Brand health multiplier
- Base growth factor

For July and October, this multiplicative effect compounds because of their high base values and seasonality indices.

## Contrasting ARIMA Forecast

Interestingly, the ARIMA model predicts decreases for both July (-33.5%) and October (-24.1%) compared to 2024. This suggests:

1. The ARIMA model may be identifying the 2024 values for these months as statistical anomalies or outliers
2. The time series pattern doesn't support the continuation of such high values
3. There may be regression to the mean occurring in the statistical forecast

## Potential Explanations

Several factors might explain the historically high values for July and October:

### July
- Peak summer travel season
- School holidays driving family travel
- Major events or festivals in the destination
- Historically favorable weather conditions

### October
- Fall/autumn travel season
- Potentially lower prices after summer peak
- Favorable weather (avoiding summer heat)
- Cultural or seasonal events (fall foliage, harvest festivals, etc.)

## Recommendations

Given the significant divergence between the factor-based and ARIMA forecasts for these months:

1. **Investigate Historical Anomalies**: Examine whether the 2024 values for July and October were influenced by one-time events or unusual circumstances

2. **Consider a Blended Approach**: For planning purposes, consider a forecast that blends the factor-based and ARIMA projections for these months

3. **Prepare Contingency Plans**: Develop flexible resource allocation strategies that can adapt if actual values fall closer to either the factor-based or ARIMA forecasts

4. **Monitor Early Indicators**: Closely track leading indicators (flight searches, website traffic) in the months preceding July and October 2025 to adjust forecasts as needed
